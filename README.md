# Guess The Track

This web app is a game that allows the user to select an artist on SoundCloud, listen to a random track of theirs, and guess the title of the track.

## How To Play

- To start the game you will first need to search for and select a Soundcloud artist.
  
- After you do that, the app will randomly select one of the artist's popular tracks on SoundCloud.
  
- You will be given 6 chances to correctly guess the title of the track selected.
  
- When you begin to type in the guessing box, song title recommendations will pop up. 
(It is recommended to select one of these before submitting, to prevent submitting an answer with punctuation/spelling errors)

- Once you believe you have the right answer, you can click submit or press enter to submit your answer.

- Each time you guess incorrectly, you will be allowed to listen to more of the song.

- Upon guessing the correct title or failing to do so, you can either choose a new artist or try again with a new track from the same artist.

*This app uses the SoundCloud V2 API to retrieve artist and track data*
